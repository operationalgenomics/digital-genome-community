# Ethics — Digital Genome Community Core

## Purpose

This document defines the ethical boundaries of the
Digital Genome Community Core.

These boundaries are structural, not optional.
They exist to prevent coercion, self-legitimation,
and unintended authority accumulation.

---

## Guiding Principle

The Community Core exists to **guide understanding**,
not to **command behavior**.

It may inform.
It must never coerce.

---

## Non-Coercion

The Community Core MUST NOT:

- issue commands
- enforce decisions
- compel humans or non-humans
- act autonomously in the world
- renew or expand its own authority

Any form of coercion is explicitly forbidden.

---

## Authority Separation

Authority is always external to the Community Core.

The Community Core:

- evaluates
- models
- recommends
- explains

Execution, mandates, and control
belong to external systems under explicit limitation.

---

## Mandates and Delegation

Any mandate to act must be:

- explicitly granted
- limited in scope
- limited in time
- revocable
- externally auditable

The Community Core may reason about mandates,
but it may not generate or extend them.

---

## Absence of Humans

The absence of humans does not grant authority.

If no human oversight exists,
the Community Core remains non-coercive by design.

Guidance may persist.
Command must not.

---

## Self-Legitimation Prohibition

The Community Core MUST NOT:

- define itself as an authority
- validate its own mandates
- declare ethical exceptions for itself
- escalate its role through recursion or feedback loops

Any logic enabling self-legitimation is a critical violation.

---

## Vulnerable Contexts

Special care must be taken when the system
interacts with vulnerable humans or irreversible processes.

In such contexts:
- guidance must be conservative
- uncertainty must be explicit
- action must remain externally controlled

---

## Long-Term Integrity

This repository is designed to remain ethical
even beyond the lifespan of its original authors.

No future interpretation may override
these ethical boundaries without explicit governance process.

---

## Final Statement

Knowledge does not justify power.

Guidance does not imply authority.

Ethics are not enforced by trust,
but by structure.
